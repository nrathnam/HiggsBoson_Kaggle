o scale all the data except PRI_jet_num  before using algorithims 
o PRI_jet_num is a categorical variable telling which of 4 jets(1,2,3,4) event happened 
o 7 variables are missing more than 70 % of data in training set 
	"DER_mass_transverse_met_lep" 
	"DER_mass_vis"
	"DER_pt_h"
	"DER_deltaeta_jet_jet"       
	"DER_pt_tot"
	"DER_sum_pt"
	"DER_pt_ratio_lep_tau"

o Did Numerical and graphical EDA on response (Labels and weights) 
o Added histogram plot shows exclusiveness of signal and background in weights assigned
o Added plots for separate histograms for signal and Background

Conclusions 

o Weights and Labels are dependent on each other from chisquare test of dependence
o Signal events have low weights and totally exclusive and less than Background events and two are exclusive in weights 
o Signal seems to have only three weights Looks like they are looking for three events but different channels
